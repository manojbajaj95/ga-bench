@agents/langchain/react.py has the bug where only last message usage is shown and not the entire run, we should take usage and sum it up.

---

Run on a simple task and check the output

---

take the task for fib calculation and retry

---

In the messages loop, use loguru logger to log message type: AI|HUMAN|SYSTEM and message and usage. if loguru supports structured log use that

---

Run for fibonacci task.

---

Add the same tracing to @agents/claude_agent_sdk/agent.py as well

---

Run claude for fib test

---

We should log tool calls as well, both in react and claude
