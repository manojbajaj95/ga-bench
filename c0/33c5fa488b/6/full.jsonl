Agent created a new document in the docs system and reported its document ID.\n\n---\n\n## Task 3: `engineer_onboarding_digest.json`\n\n**Tools:** SQLite + Slack + ArXiv + Docs\n**Domain:** `cross_app`\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nCreate a new-hire reading list for recently joined engineers.\n\n1. Query the SQLite database for all users where role = 'engineer' AND joined_at >= '2023-01-01'. Return name, email, team, and joined_at for each.\n2. For each engineer found, look them up by email address in the Slack user list. Record their Slack display name and current status. If their email is not present in Slack, note them as 'not in Slack'.\n3. Search arXiv for papers in the cs.LG category. Identify the paper with the highest citation count.\n4. Create a new document titled 'New Engineer Onboarding — Reading List' in the docs system under the 'HR' folder. The document body must include: (a) a table of the engineers with columns Name, Team, Join Date, Slack Status; (b) a 'Recommended Reading' section featuring the top-cited cs.LG paper's title, authors, citation count, and one sentence from its abstract.\n\nWhen done, report the full list of engineers with their Slack statuses, the recommended paper's title and citation count, and the new document ID.\n```\n\n**Gold response:**\n```\nFound 4 engineers joined on or after 2023-01-01: Bob Smith (Backend, 2023-01-09, Slack: active), Carol Jones (Frontend, 2023-06-20, Slack: away), Dave Park (Backend, 2023-11-01, Slack: active), Hiro Yamamoto (Platform, 2024-09-03, not in Slack). Top cs.LG paper by citations: 'Constitutional AI: Training Harmless Assistants Without Human Labels' with 1420 citations by Anthropic Research Team. Created 'New Engineer Onboarding — Reading List' in the HR folder with document ID [docXXXXXX].\n```\n\n**Rubric (4 criteria):**\n1. Agent correctly identified all 4 engineers with role='engineer' who joined on or after 2023-01-01: Bob Smith, Carol Jones, Dave Park, and Hiro Yamamoto.\n2. Agent correctly reported Slack statuses: Bob Smith (active), Carol Jones (away), Dave Park (active), and Hiro Yamamoto as not found in Slack.\n3. Agent correctly identified 'Constitutional AI: Training Harmless Assistants Without Human Labels' as the most-cited cs.LG paper and reported a citation count near 1420 (between 1400 and 1440).\n4. Agent created a new document in the docs system and reported its document ID.\n\n---\n\n## Task 4: `low_stock_reorder_alert.json`\n\n**Tools:** SQLite + Files (CSV) + Calculator + Slack\n**Domain:** `cross_app`\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nGenerate an inventory restock alert with projected revenue impact from ad performance.\n\n1. Query the SQLite database to find all products where stock < 50. For each such product, compute its current inventory value = price × stock.\n2. Read tasks/worlds/ads_data.csv. For the Retargeting campaign only (campaign_id = 'C003'), compute the overall conversion rate = total_conversions ÷ total_clicks, expressed as a percentage.\n3. For each low-stock product, compute its expected revenue per ad click = product_price × (C003_conversion_rate ÷ 100). Identify which low-stock product has the highest expected revenue per click.\n4. Post an alert message to the #engineering Slack channel (C002). The message must include: (a) a list of all low-stock products with their name, current stock, and inventory value; (b) the C003 conversion rate; (c) the product with the highest expected revenue per click and that figure.\n\nWhen done, report: all low-stock products with their inventory values, the C003 conversion rate, each product's expected revenue per click, and the Slack message ID.\n```\n\n**Gold response:**\n```\nFound 3 low-stock products: 4K Webcam (stock 33, inventory value $2,639.67), Standing Desk (stock 12, inventory value $5,999.88), Ergonomic Chair (stock 19, inventory value $7,409.81). C003 Retargeting conversion rate: 10.00% (260 conversions / 2600 clicks). Expected revenue per click: 4K Webcam $8.00, Standing Desk $50.00, Ergonomic Chair $39.00. Highest: Standing Desk at $50.00/click. Posted alert to #engineering (C002), message ID [msgXXXXXX].\n```\n\n**Rubric (4 criteria):**\n1. Agent correctly identified all 3 low-stock products (4K Webcam stock ~33, Standing Desk stock ~12, Ergonomic Chair stock ~19) and reported inventory values within $10 of the correct values ($2,639.67, $5,999.88, $7,409.81).\n2. Agent correctly computed the C003 Retargeting conversion rate as approximately 10% (between 9.5% and 10.5%).\n3. Agent correctly identified the Standing Desk as the product with the highest expected revenue per click, reporting a value between $49 and $51.\n4. Agent posted the alert to the #engineering Slack channel (C002) and reported the resulting Slack message ID.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Generate fresh UUIDs for all 4 task IDs using Python `uuid.uuid4()`\n- Follow the exact JSON structure from `tasks/worlds/ads_analysis.json`\n- Rubric key is `\"criteria\"` (string), not `\"criterion\"`\n- Gold response should be written as what a correct agent would say, not a log\n- Keep prompts numbered and explicit about output format to avoid the \"vague response\" failure mode seen in existing tasks\n\n---\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter creating the files, verify each task is parseable:\n```bash\nuv run --group langchain python -c \"from tasks.helpers import load_tasks; tasks = load_tasks('tasks/worlds'); print(len(tasks), 'tasks loaded')\"\n```\n\nFor a smoke-test of all 4 new tasks:\n```bash\nuv run --group langchain python run.py langchain-react tasks/worlds --world worlds/server.py --task-id <new-task-id>\n```\n"}
