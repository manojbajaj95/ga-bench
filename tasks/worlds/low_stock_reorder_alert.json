For each such product, compute its current inventory value = price × stock.\n2. Read tasks/worlds/ads_data.csv. For the Retargeting campaign only (campaign_id = 'C003'), compute the overall conversion rate = total_conversions ÷ total_clicks, expressed as a percentage.\n3. For each low-stock product, compute its expected revenue per ad click = product_price × (C003_conversion_rate ÷ 100). Identify which low-stock product has the highest expected revenue per click.\n4. Post an alert message to the #engineering Slack channel (C002). The message must include: (a) a list of all low-stock products with their name, current stock, and inventory value; (b) the C003 conversion rate; (c) the product with the highest expected revenue per click and that figure.\n\nWhen done, report: all low-stock products with their inventory values, the C003 conversion rate, each product's expected revenue per click, and the Slack message ID.",
