Query the SQLite database to compute total delivered revenue grouped by user team: join the users and orders tables, filter for status = 'delivered', group by team. Exclude users with a NULL team.\n2. Fetch the current stock price for NVDA from the market data.\n3. For each team that has delivered revenue greater than $0, calculate how many fractional NVDA shares that team's total delivered spend could purchase (team_spend ÷ NVDA_price), rounded to 3 decimal places.\n4. Create a new document titled 'Team Purchasing Power — Feb 2026' in the docs system under the 'Finance' folder. The document must contain a table with columns: Team, Total Delivered Spend, NVDA Share Equivalent.\n\nWhen done, report each team's delivered spend and NVDA share equivalent, the NVDA price used, and the new document ID.",
