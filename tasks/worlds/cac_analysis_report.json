Query the SQLite database to find: (a) the count of unique customer IDs who have at least one delivered order, and (b) the total delivered revenue (sum of the 'total' column where status = 'delivered').\n2. Read the file at tasks/worlds/ads_data.csv and compute the total ad spend across all rows (sum of the 'spend' column).\n3. Using the calculator, compute: (a) blended Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) = total_ad_spend ÷ unique_delivered_customers; (b) average customer Lifetime Value (LTV) = total_delivered_revenue ÷ unique_delivered_customers; (c) LTV:CAC ratio = avg_LTV ÷ CAC, rounded to 2 decimal places.\n4. Create a new document titled 'Marketing Efficiency Report — Feb 2026' in the docs system under the 'Finance' folder. The document body must include: unique delivered-customer count, total delivered revenue, total ad spend, blended CAC, average LTV, and LTV:CAC ratio.\n\nWhen done, report all six computed figures and the new document ID.",
